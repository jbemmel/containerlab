# VM-based routers integration

Containerlab focuses on containers, but many routing products ship only in virtual machine packaging. Leaving containerlab users without the ability to create topologies with both containerized and VM-based routing systems would have been a shame.

Keeping this requirement in mind from the very beginning, we added [`bridge`](../lab-examples/ext-bridge.md)/[`ovs-bridge`](kinds/ovs-bridge.md) kind that allows bridging your containerized topology with other resources available via a bridged network. For example, a VM based router:

<div class="mxgraph" style="max-width:100%;border:1px solid transparent;margin:0 auto; display:block;" data-mxgraph="{&quot;page&quot;:0,&quot;zoom&quot;:1.5,&quot;highlight&quot;:&quot;#0000ff&quot;,&quot;nav&quot;:true,&quot;check-visible-state&quot;:true,&quot;resize&quot;:true,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srl-labs/containerlab/diagrams/vrnetlab.drawio&quot;}"></div>

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://viewer.diagrams.net/js/viewer-static.min.js" async></script>

With this approach, you could bridge VM-based routing systems by attaching interfaces to the bridge you define in your topology. However, it doesn't allow users to define the VM-based nodes in the same topology file. With [`vrnetlab`](https://github.com/hellt/vrnetlab) integration, containerlab is now capable of launching topologies with VM-based routers defined in the same topology file.

## Vrnetlab

Vrnetlab packages a regular VM inside a container and makes it runnable as if it was a container image.

To make this work, vrnetlab provides a set of scripts that build the container image out of a user-provided VM disk. This integration enables containerlab to build topologies that consist both of native containerized NOSes and VMs:

<div class="mxgraph" style="max-width:100%;border:1px solid transparent;margin:0 auto; display:block;" data-mxgraph="{&quot;page&quot;:1,&quot;zoom&quot;:1.5,&quot;highlight&quot;:&quot;#0000ff&quot;,&quot;nav&quot;:true,&quot;check-visible-state&quot;:true,&quot;resize&quot;:true,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srl-labs/containerlab/diagrams/vrnetlab.drawio&quot;}"></div>

!!! warning
    Ensure that the VM that containerlab runs on has [Nested virtualization enabled](https://stafwag.github.io/blog/blog/2018/06/04/nested-virtualization-in-kvm/) to support vrnetlab-based containers.

### Compatibility matrix

To make vrnetlab images to work with container-based networking in containerlab, we needed to [fork](https://github.com/hellt/vrnetlab) vrnetlab project and implement the necessary improvements. VM-based routers that you intend to run with containerlab should be built with [`hellt/vrnetlab`](https://github.com/hellt/vrnetlab) project, and not with the upstream `vrnetlab/vrnetlab`.

Containerlab depends on `hellt/vrnetlab` project, and sometimes features added in containerlab must be implemented in `vrnetlab` (and vice-versa). This leads to a cross-dependency between these projects.

The following table provides a link between the version combinations:

???note "how to understand version inter-dependency between containerlab and vrnetlab?"
    When new VM-based platform support is added to vrnetlab, it is usually accompanied by a new containerlab version. In this case the table row will have both containerlab and vrnetlab versions.  
    When vrnetlab adds new features that don't require containerlab changes, the table will have only vrnetlab version.  
    When containerlab adds new features that don't require vrnetlab changes, the table will not list containerlab version.

    It is worth noting, that you can use the latest containerlab version with a given vrnetlab version, even if the table doesn't list the latest containerlab version.

### Building vrnetlab images

To build a vrnetlab image compatible with containerlab, users first need to ensure that the versions of both projects follow [compatibility matrix](#compatibility-matrix).

1. Clone [`hellt/vrnetlab`](https://github.com/hellt/vrnetlab) and checkout to a version compatible with containerlab release:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hellt/vrnetlab && cd vrnetlab
   
   # assuming we are running containerlab 0.11.0,
   # the latest compatible vrnetlab version is 0.2.3
   # at the moment of this writing
   git checkout v0.2.3
   ```

2. Enter the directory for the image of interest

   ```
   cd sros
   ```

3. Follow the build instructions from the README.md file in the image directory

### Supported VM products

The images that work with containerlab will appear in the supported list as we implement the necessary integration.

### Connection modes

Containerlab offers several ways of connecting VM-based routers with the rest of the docker workloads. By default, vrnetlab integrated routers will use **tc** backend[^2], which doesn't require any additional packages to be installed on the container host and supports transparent passage of LACP frames.

<div class="mxgraph" style="max-width:100%;border:1px solid transparent;margin:0 auto; display:block;" data-mxgraph="{&quot;page&quot;:6,&quot;zoom&quot;:1.5,&quot;highlight&quot;:&quot;#0000ff&quot;,&quot;nav&quot;:true,&quot;check-visible-state&quot;:true,&quot;resize&quot;:true,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srl-labs/containerlab/diagrams/vrnetlab.drawio&quot;}"></div>

??? "Any other datapaths?"
    Although `tc` based datapath should cover all the needed connectivity requirements, if other bridge-like datapaths are needed, Containerlab offers OpenvSwitch and Linux bridge modes.  
    Users can plug in those datapaths by specifying `CONNECTION_MODE` env variable:
    ```yaml
    # the env variable can also be set in the defaults section
    name: myTopo

    topology:
      nodes:
        sr1:
          kind: nokia_sros
          image: vrnetlab/nokia_sros:20.10.R1
          env:
            CONNECTION_MODE: bridge # use `ovs` for openvswitch datapath
    ```

### Boot order

A simultaneous boot of many qemu nodes may stress the underlying system, which sometimes renders in a boot loop or system halt. If the container host doesn't have enough capacity to bear the simultaneous boot of many qemu nodes, it is still possible to successfully run them by scheduling their boot time.

Starting with v0.51.0 users may define a "staged" boot process by defining the [`stages`](nodes.md#stages) and `wait-for` dependencies between the VM-based nodes.

Consider the following example where the first SR OS nodes will boot immediately, whereas the second node will wait till the first node is reached the `healthy` stage:

```yaml
name: boot-order
topology:
  nodes:
    sr1:
      kind: nokia_sros
      image: nokia_sros:latest
    sr2:
      kind: nokia_sros
      image: nokia_sros:latest
      stages:
        create:
          wait-for:
            - node: sr1
              stage: healthy
```

### Boot delay

A predecessor of the Boot Order is the boot delay that can be set with `BOOT_DELAY` environment variable that the supported VM-based nodes will respect.

Consider the following example where the first SR OS nodes will boot immediately, whereas the second node will sleep for 30 seconds and then start the boot process:

```yaml
name: boot-delay
topology:
  nodes:
    sr1:
      kind: nokia_sros
      image: nokia_sros:21.2.R1
      license: license-sros21.txt
    sr2:
      kind: nokia_sros
      image: nokia_sros:21.2.R1
      license: license-sros21.txt
      env:
        # boot delay in seconds
        BOOT_DELAY: 30
```

This method is not as flexible as the Boot Order, since you rely on the fixed delay, and it doesn't allow for the dynamic boot order based on the node health.

### Memory optimization

Typically a lab consists of a few types of VMs which are spawned and interconnected with each other. Consider a lab consisting of 5 interconnected routers; one router uses VM image X, and four routers use VM image Y.

Effectively we run just two types of VMs in that lab, and thus we can implement a memory deduplication technique that drastically reduces the memory footprint of a lab. In Linux, this can be achieved with technologies like UKSM/KSM. Refer to [this article](https://netdevops.me/2021/how-to-patch-ubuntu-2004-focal-fossa-with-uksm/) that explains the methodology and provides steps to get UKSM working on Ubuntu/Fedora systems.
