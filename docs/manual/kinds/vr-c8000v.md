# Cisco c8000v

The Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software (Catalyst 8000V) is a virtual-form-factor router and is identified with `cisco_c8000v` kind in the [topology file](../topo-def-file.md).

Cisco c8000v is a successor of [Cisco CSR1000v](../kinds/vr-csr.md) and is a **different** product from [Cisco 8000](../kinds/c8000.md) platform emulator.

## Hardware resource requirements

Each c8000v node is started with 1vCPU and 4GB of RAM by default.

## Managing c8000v nodes

/// note
Cisco c8000v boots process takes around 5 minutes. To monitor boot progress:

```bash
docker logs -f <container-name/id>
```

Wait for `Startup complete in: <time>` message.
///

/// tab | SSH

`ssh admin@<node-name>`
Password: `admin`
///
/// tab | bash
to connect to a `bash` shell of a running c8000v container:

```bash
docker exec -it <container-name/id> bash
```

///

/// note
Default credentials: `admin:admin`
///

## Interface naming convention

c8000v container uses the following naming convention for its management and data interfaces:

- `eth0` - management interface connected to the containerlab management network
- `eth1` - Gi2 interface
- `eth2` - Gi3 interface and so on.

When containerlab launches c8000v node, it will set the static IPv4 address for the `eth0` interface and other interfaces will appear unset.

```
node1#sh ip int br
Interface              IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol
GigabitEthernet1       10.0.0.15       YES manual up                    up      
GigabitEthernet2       unassigned      YES unset  administratively down down
```

## Features and options

### Default node configuration

It is possible to launch nodes of `cisco_c8000v` kind with a basic config or to provide a custom config file that will be used as a startup config instead.

When a node is defined without `startup-config` statement present, the node will boot with a factory config

### User defined config

With a [`startup-config`](../nodes.md#startup-config) property a user sets the path to the config file that will be mounted to a container and used as a startup-config:

```yaml
name: c8000v
topology:
  nodes:
    c8000:
      kind: cisco_c8000v
      startup-config: r1.cfg
```

When a config file is passed via `startup-config` parameter it will be used during an initial lab deployment. However, a config file that might be in the lab directory of a node takes precedence over the startup-config[^1].

## Lab examples

```yaml
name: c8000v
topology:
  nodes:
    node1:
      kind: cisco_c8000v
      image: vrnetlab/vr-c8000v:17.11.01a
    node2:
      kind: cisco_c8000v
      image: vrnetlab/vr-c8000v:17.11.01a

  links:
    - endpoints: ["node1:eth1", "node2:eth1"]

```

[^1]: if startup config needs to be enforced, either deploy a lab with `--reconfigure` flag, or use [`enforce-startup-config`](../nodes.md#enforce-startup-config) setting.
