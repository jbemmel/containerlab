# Release 0.34 :christmas_tree:

:material-calendar: 2022-12-23

## Cisco XRd support

Thanks to @trustywolf we finally landed support for [Cisco XRd](../manual/kinds/xrd.md)! No more dealing with a 16GB mem-hungry VM monster when all you need is a control plane. #1144

## Major codebase refactoring

@steiler went into the berzerk mode and refactored half of the containerlab's internal code base to have a cleaner separation of packages, internal APIs and increased extensibility.

This change was carried over in multiple PRs and touched a lot of files; while we did quite some testing and maintained the same user experience, there might be things that work differently, do let us know if there is something out of order.

## Miscellaneous

* Containerlab can now be installed on Core OS #1115
* Fixed pull image function to support pulling images without explicit tags #1123
* Memory calculation function has been fixed to report on available memory, not just free one #1133
