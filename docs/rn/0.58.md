## Cisco IOL

Yes, "IOS on Linux" was a hot thing in early 2000s, but if you don't need datapath features and just want to have a lightweight Cisco IOS - [Cisco IOL](../manual/kinds/cisco_iol.md) is as light as it gets.

Thanks to @kaelemc and @DanPartelly and their work in #2211, #2235 and https://github.com/hellt/vrnetlab/pull/256 and https://github.com/hellt/vrnetlab/pull/257 you can now experience Cisco IOL in containerlab.

Getting an IOS prompt was never easier, and faster!

## Cisco vIOS

Another good news for Cisco fanboys and fangirls, there is yet another NOS, apparently abbreviated as [vIOS](https://github.com/hellt/vrnetlab/tree/master/vios) that is now supported in containerlab thanks to the effort from @jaro0149 in https://github.com/hellt/vrnetlab/pull/249.

This variant doesn't have its own `kind` in containerlab, because you can get away with the regular `linux` kind, as explained in the [docs](https://github.com/hellt/vrnetlab/tree/master/vios).

## Huawei VRP

And yet another contribution to vrnetlab/containerlab that adds a new system - this time from @rafabr and his work in https://github.com/hellt/vrnetlab/pull/250 that adds [`huawei_vrp`](../manual/kinds/huawei_vrp.md) system.

Both N40E and CE12800 images were tested and they come with startup-config support. Great work @rafabr!

## Miscellaneous

- vrnetlab images are now tagged with `vrnetlab-version` label to help you identify when they were build and off of which vrnetlab commit
- updated N9Kv system requirements (cpu and mem bump)
- ssh config file is now explicitly created with `644` permissions
- documentation prefix `3fff` is used for v6 addresses for containerlab-driven management addresses. Thanks @hyposcaler-bot
