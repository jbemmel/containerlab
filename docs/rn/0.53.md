# Release 0.53

:material-calendar: 2024-03-25 Â· :material-list-status: [Full Changelog](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/releases)

## Fortinet Fortigate

@robotwalk added support for the Fortinet Fortigate firewall image. Refer to the [`fortinet_fortigate`](../manual/kinds/fortinet_fortigate.md) kind documentation to learn more about the supported options.

## FreeBSD

After clearing the OpenBSD, @dteslya added support for the [FreeBSD](../manual/kinds/freebsd.md) kind as well!

## Containerlab to Drawio

@FloSch62 created a new tool - [clab-io-draw](https://github.com/srl-labs/clab-io-draw/) - that allows containerlab users to generate drawio (aka diagrams.net) diagrams from their containerlab topologies. The tool is available as a standalone container image, and we packaged it under the [`containerlab graph --drawio`](../cmd/graph.md) command to make it easier to use.

This feature is in the "preview" status, we will likely change the command structure in the next release.
