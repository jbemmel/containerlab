## Interface aliases

We know, it has been a long time coming, but thanks to a brilliant contribution done by [@vista-](https://github.com/vista-) in #2124 we now have added support for [interface aliases](../manual/topo-def-file.md#interface-naming).

What are interface aliases you ask? They are a way to use interface names as you see them in the NOS CLI, rather than the default `ethX` naming scheme. It is a convenience feature, but, oh boy, how much easier is it to define links when you don't have to keep doing the mental gymnastics of mapping `eth0` to `Gi0/1` and so on.

Interface aliases will be also displayed in the [generated graph](../cmd/graph.md#html) and even in the [edgeshark](../manual/wireshark.md#edgeshark-integration) web view.

## Ostinato support

We have added support for [Ostinato](https://ostinato.org/) traffic generator in containerlab. You can now define Ostinato nodes in your topology file and use them to generate traffic between your nodes.

See the [Ostinato integration](../manual/kinds/ostinato.md) page for more details.

## SONiC

We have added support for the following new SONiC kinds:

- [`sonic-vm`](../manual/kinds/sonic-vm.md) - is a VM-based upstream SONiC. You may want to pick sonic-vm over [sonic-vs](../manual/kinds/sonic-vs.md) if you hit some issues with the original sonic container. Added by @adam-kulagowski in #2120
- [`dell_sonic`](../manual/kinds/dell_sonic.md) - is a SONiC distribution by Dell #2125

## Multi-arch `clab` container build

To support the imminent release of ARM64 friendly Network OSes we fine tuned the release pipeline to make sure the `clab` container is built for both `amd64` and `arm64` architectures. #2128

## Cisco Catalyst 9000v

Thanks to our strong community and @kaelemc in particular, we have added support for the [Cisco Catalyst 9000v](../manual/kinds/vr-cat9kv.md) switch. #2133

## Miscellaneous

- Additions to the Developers Guide done by @pstavirs go about how to contribute to the documentation and how to build the documentation locally. #2109
- Added more community posts in #2127
