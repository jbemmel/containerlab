# Release 0.57

:material-calendar: 2024-08-22 Â· :material-list-status: [Full Changelog](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/releases)

## Dell SONiC startup config handling

The [Dell SONiC](../manual/kinds/dell_sonic.md) support has been improved by adding startup-config handling and saving #2175

## Quick setup script improvements

The quick setup script has been improved to ensure even smoother installation experience.

- RHEL-based systems are now supported so you can install containerlab in one click on your RHELs and Rocky's. #2137
- a sudoers file is now created to allow SSH_AUTH_SOCK env var to persist when using sudo. This allows the user to use the ssh agent of the original user when deploying a lab with `sudo`
- it is no fun to use a cloud system with a lousy shell prompt. If you don't have time to setup your own custom prompt, you can now use one of the functions in the quick setup script to install a lightweight 2-line bash prompt #2174

    ```bash
    curl -sL https://containerlab.dev/setup | sudo -E bash -s "setup-bash-prompt"
    ```

## Lab owner information

When running in multi-user environments with several lab owners using the same containerlab host, it is important to know which lab belongs to which user. To address this, a new table column "Owner" was added to the output.

This column is populated with the username of the user who started the lab and is displayed when `--wide` flag is provided to the `inspect` command. #2161

## Miscellaneous

- to decouple the containerlab CLI from the clab2drawio project, the `--drawio-args` flag was added to the `graph` command to allow customization of the drawio generation out of band #2143
- Ixia/Keysight OTG updates #2156
- improvements to docker user password handling #2167
- various template files have been embedded into the binary, instead of polluting the `/etc/containerlab` directory #2169
