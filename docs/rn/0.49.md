:material-calendar: 2023-12-21 Â· :material-list-status: [Full Changelog](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/releases)

## Healthchecks

@steiler added support for container [healthchecks](../manual/nodes.md#healthcheck) in #1426. Now you can specify healthcheck parameters for your containers in the lab topology file and Containerlab will configure the healthcheck for you.

This allows you to monitor health of your containerlab nodes as well as serves as a prerequisite for the upcoming [dependency manager improvements](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/pull/1759) to create dependencies on healthiness of the lab nodes.

## OpenBSD support

Fearless @dteslya added support for the mighty [OpenBSD](../manual/kinds/openbsd.md) in #1762. Not only you can deploy labs with OpenBSD, but also startup config support were baked in.

## Juniper Evolved (EVO) support

Thanks to @akielaries Containerlab got another platform under its belt! Welcome [Juniper vJunos-Evolved](../manual/kinds/vr-vjunosevolved.md) #1775.

## Cisco FTDv support

Again thanks to @dteslya we now have support for [Cisco FTDv](../manual/kinds/vr-ftdv.md) platform #1783.

## Miscellaneous

* Ctrl+C now does not remove the lab files #1769
* When using filters to execute commands with [`exec`](../cmd/exec.md), the error is now returned if no nodes match the filter #1786
* ixia-c example lab has been updated by @bortok to feature latest developments done for the ixia-c kind #1795
