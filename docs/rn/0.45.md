# Release 0.45

:material-calendar: 2023-09-20 Â· :material-list-status: [Full Changelog](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/releases)

## vJunos-switch

Thanks to contributions from @akielaries done in #1553 and accompanying vrnetlab PR containerlab gets support for [Juniper vJunos-switch](../manual/kinds/vr-vjunosswitch.md). This is a new VM-based virtual product from Juniper that has been integrated in containerlab by juniper folks, kudos to them!

## Find topology file in a directory

For quite a while containerlab had two ways of finding which topology file to use when deploying/destroing/inspecting a lab:

1. when users provide a path to a topology file via `-t` flag, containerlab will use that file
2. when users do not provide a path to a topology file (no `-t` flag present), containerlab would search for a file named `*.clab.yml` in the current directory and use it.

Now @steiler enhanced this functionality by making sure that if a user provides a path with `-t` flag that points to a directory, then we will apply topology file finding logic in this directory, instead of bailing out with an error.

## suppress-startup-config

@bewing added a new node parameter called [`suppress-config`](../manual/nodes.md#suppress-startup-config) to give users ability to suppress startup config generation for a given node or a set of nodes. This is particularly useful in scenarios when you want to test ZTP and thus make sure containerlab doesn't add anything on its own accord.
