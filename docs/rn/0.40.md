## IPv4/6 SANs for SR Linux

In #1345 we added support for IPv4/6 SANs for SR Linux nodes. With this addition, the certificate will contain IPv4/6 addresses assigned by the container runtime as SANs, so TLS connections can be established using these addresses.

## Miscellaneous

* SR Linux variants D4 and H4 have been added #1339
* Deploy command honors Ctrl-C and cleans up interrupted deployment #1340
* SR Linux agent path can now be a remote HTTP(S) URL #1336
* Improvements to the license handling process #1330
* Doc examples updated to comply with changes in SR Linux 23.3.1 #1341
