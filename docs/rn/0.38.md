# Release 0.38

:material-calendar: 2023-03-13 Â· :material-list-status: [Full Changelog](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/releases)

## Remote startup-configs

Node's [`startup-config`](../manual/nodes.md#startup-config) can now point to a remote http/https location. Containerlab will download the remote file and use it as a startup-config. #1283

## Link MTU

Now users can set the MTU of the link between two nodes. This is done by [setting the `mtu`](../manual/network.md#link-mtu) field in the link definition. Prior to that change, MTU was always 9500B. #1285

## Miscellaneous

* Network mode `none` has been added to allow running nodes without docker networking #1284
* Fix extra newline chars added to files that already had one #1286
* Default interface name checks are no longer enforced, with only specific kinds using them #1276
* Updated Go to v1.20 #1287
