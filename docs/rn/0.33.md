## External container kind

With a new [`ext-container`](../manual/kinds/ext-container.md) kind it is possible to enrich clab topology with nodes scheduled by other tools (e.g. `k8s-kind`). Thanks @steiler.

## Graph enhancements

Thanks to @gamerslouis our [graph](../cmd/graph.md) feature got some important fixes like properly displaying bridge properties in #1097 and renders bridges in offline mode in #1098.

## SR OS and BOF persistency

Making SR OS BOF persistent was not a trivial task, but @mabra94 added a nice doc section explaining how bind mounts and boot-good-exec SR OS option combined can achieve that. #1107

## Miscellaneous

* fixed ssse3 check #1092
* housekeeping item by @steiler - default node embedding #1099
* startup-config support for PAN OS nodes #1109
* save CPU from spinning when waiting for nodes to boot #1108
