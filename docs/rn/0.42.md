# Release 0.42

:material-calendar: 2023-06-17 Â· :material-list-status: [Full Changelog](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/releases)

## Home dir for `sudo` user

Now when you run `sudo containerlab deploy`, the topology files will be searched in the home directory of the user that runs the command and not the root user. Before that change users had to use `sudo -E` to preserve the environment variables and run the command as the current user. Now we made it simpler, just in the spirit of containerlab. #1412
