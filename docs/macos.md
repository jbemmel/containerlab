# Containerlab on macOS

/// details | Summary for the impatient
    type: subtle-note

1. Install [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev)[^1] on your macOS
2. Create an **arm64** Linux VM using OrbStack
3. Install containerlab in the VM using the usual [installation instructions](install.md)
4. Check what images can/should work on ARM64
5. Deploy your lab. You can see the demo of this workflow in [this YT video][yt-demo].

Or use the [Devcontainer](#devcontainer) if running another VM is not your thing.

[yt-demo]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BTa-CiTpvI&t=1573s

<small>If you run an Intel mac, you still use OrbStack to deploy a VM, but you will not need to worry about the hard-to-find ARM64 images, as your processor runs x86_64 natively.</small>
///

For quite some time, we have been saying that containerlab and macOS is a challenging mix. This statement has been echoed through multiple workshops/demos and was based on the following reasons:

1. **ARM64 Network OS images**: With the shift to ARM64 architecture made by Apple (and Microsoft[^2]), we found ourselves in a situation where 99% of existing network OSes were not compiled for ARM64 architecture. This meant that containerlab users would have to rely on x86_64 emulation via Rosetta or QEMU, which imposes a significant performance penalty, often making the emulation unusable for practical purposes.
2. **Docker on macOS**: Since containerlab is reliant on Docker for container orchestrations, it needs Docker to be natively installed on the host.  
    On macOS, Docker is always provided as a Linux/arm64 VM that runs the docker daemon, with docker-cli running on macOS natively. You can imagine, that dealing with a VM that runs a network topology poses some UX challenges, like getting access to the exposed ports or dealing with files on macOS that needs to be accessible to the Docker VM.  
3. **Linux on macOS?** It is not only Docker that containerlab is based on. We leverage some Linux kernel APIs (like netlink) either directly or via Docker to be available to setup links, namespaces, bind-mounts, etc.  
    Naturally, Darwin (macOS kernel) is not Linux, and while it is POSIX compliant, it is not a drop-in replacement for Linux. This means that some of the Linux-specific features that containerlab relies on are simply not present on macOS.

Looking at the above challenges one might think that containerlab on macOS is a lost cause. However, recently things have started to take a good course, and we are happy to say that for certain labs Containerlab on macOS might be even a better (!) choice overall.

As a long time macOS user, Roman recorded an in-depth video demonstrating how to run containerlab topologies on macOS using the tools of his choice. You can watch the video below or jump to the text version of the guide below.

## Network OS Images

The first thing one needs to understand that if you run macOS on ARM chipset (M1+), then you should use ARM64 network OS images whenever possible. This will give you the best performance and compatibility.

With Rosetta virtualisation it is possible to run x86_64 images on ARM64, but this comes with the performance penalty that might even make nodes not work at all.

/// admonition | VM-based images
    type: warning
VM-based images built with [hellt/vrnetlab](manual/vrnetlab.md) require nested virtualization support, which is only available on M3+ chip with macOS version 15 and above.

If you happen to satisfy these requirements, please let us know in the comments which images you were able to run on your M3+ Mac.
///

### Native ARM64 Network OS and application images

Finally :pray: some good news on this front, as vendors started to release or at least announce ARM64 versions of their network OSes.  
**Nokia** first [released](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rdodin_oops-we-did-it-again-three-years-ago-activity-7234176896018632704-Ywk-/) the preview version of their freely distributed [SR Linux for ARM64](manual/kinds/srl.md#getting-sr-linux-image), and **Arista** announced the imminent cEOS availability sometime in 2024.

You can also get [**FRR**](https://quay.io/repository/frrouting/frr?tab=tags) container for ARM64 architecture from their container registry.

And if all you have to play with is pure control plane, you can use Juniper cRPD, which is also available for ARM64.

Yes, SR Linux, cEOS, FRR do not cover all the network OSes out there, but it is a good start, and we hope that more vendors will follow the trend.

The good news is that almost all of the popular applications that we see being used in containerlabs are **already** built for ARM. Your streaming telemetry stack (gnmic, prometheus/influx, grafana), regular client-emulating endpoints such as Alpine or a collection of network related tools in the network-multitool image had already been supporting ARM architecture. You can leverage the sheer ecosystem multi-arch applications that are available in the public registries.

### Running under Rosetta

If the image you're looking for is not available in ARM64, you can still try running the AMD64 version of the image under Rosetta emulation. Rosetta is a macOS virtualisation layer that allows you running x86_64 code on ARM64 architecture.

It has been known to work for the following images:

- [Arista cEOS x64](manual/kinds/ceos.md)
- [Cisco IOL](manual/kinds/cisco_iol.md)

## Docker on macOS

Ever since macOS switched to ARM architecture for their processors, people in a "containers camp" have been busy making sure that Docker works well on macOS's new architecture.

### How Docker runs on Macs

But before we start talking about Docker on ARM Macs, let's remind ourselves how Docker works on macOS with Intel processors.

-{{ diagram(url='srl-labs/containerlab/diagrams/macos-arm.drawio', title='Docker on Intel Macs', page=3) }}-

At the heart of any product or project that enables the Docker engine on Mac[^3] is a Linux VM that hosts the Docker daemon, aka "the engine". This VM is created and managed by the application that sets up Docker on your desktop OS.  
The Linux VM is a mandatory piece because the whole container ecosystem is built around Linux kernel features and APIs. Therefore, running Docker on any host with an operating system other than Linux requires a Linux VM.

As shown above, on Intel Macs, the macOS runs Darwin kernel on top of an AMD64 (aka x86_64) architecture, and consequently, the Docker VM runs the same architecture. The architecture of the Docker VM is the same as the host architecture allowing for a performant virtualization, since no processor emulation is needed.

Now let's see how things change when we switch to ARM Macs:

-{{ diagram(url='srl-labs/containerlab/diagrams/macos-arm.drawio', title='Docker on ARM Macs', page=2) }}-

The diagram looks 99% the same as for the Intel Macs, the only difference being the architecture that macOS runs on and consequently the architecture of the Docker VM.  
Now we run ARM64 architecture on the host, and the Docker VM is also ARM64.

/// details | Native vs Emulation

If Docker runs exactly the same on ARM Macs as it does on Intel Macs, then why is it suddenly a problem to run containerlab on ARM Macs?

Well, it all comes down to the requirement of having ARM64 network OS images that we discussed earlier. Now when your Docker VM runs Linux/ARM64, you can run natively only ARM64-native software in it, and we, as a network community, are not having a lot of ARM64-native network OSes. It is getting better, but we are not there yet to claim 100% parity with the x86_64 world.

You should strive to run the native images as much as possible, as it gives you the best performance and compatibility. But how do you tell if the image is ARM64-native or not?  
A lot of applications that you might want to run in your containerlab topologies are already ARM64-native and often available as a multi-arch image.

When running the following `docker image inspect` command, you can grep the `Architecture` field to see if the image is ARM64-native:

```bash
docker image inspect ghcr.io/nokia/srlinux:24.10.1 -f '{{.Architecture}}'
arm64
```

Running the same command for an image that is not ARM64-native will return `amd64`:

```bash
docker image inspect goatatwork/snmpwalk -f '{{.Architecture}}'
amd64
```

Still, it will be possible to run the `snmpwalk` container, thanks to Rosetta emulation.
///

### Software

There are many software solutions that deliver Docker on macOS, both for Intel and ARM Macs.

- :star: [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) - a great UX and performance. A choice of many and is recommended by Containerlab maintainer. Free for personal use.
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) - the original and the most popular Docker on macOS.
- [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) - another popular software.
- [Container Desktop](https://container-desktop.com/) - a cross-platform solution.
- [CoLima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) - a lightweight, CLI-based VM solution.

The way most users use Containerlab on macOS, though, not directly leveraging Docker that is provided by one of the above solutions. Instead, it might be easier to spin up a VM, powered by the above-mentioned software products, and install Containerlab natively inside this arm64/Linux VM.  
You can see this workflow demonstration in this [YT video][yt-demo].

## Devcontainer

Another convenient option to run containerlab on ARM/Intel Macs (and [Windows](windows.md#devcontainer)) is to use the [Devcontainer](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers) feature that works great with VS Code and many other IDE's.

A development container (or devcontainer) allows you to use a container as a full-featured development environment. By creating the `devcontainer.json`[^4] file, you define the development environment for your project. Containerlab project maintains a set of pre-built multi-arch devcontainer images that you can use to run containerlabs.  
It was initially created to power [containerlab in codespaces](manual/codespaces.md), but it is a perfect fit for running containerlab on a **wide range of OSes** such as macOS and Windows.

/// note | Requirements

1. Starting with **Containerlab v0.60.0**, you can use the devcontainer with ARM64 macOS to run containerlabs.
2. VS Code [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) needs to be installed to use this feature with VS Code.
///

To start using the devcontainer, you have to create a `devcontainer.json` file in your project directory where you have your containerlab topology. If you're using Containerlab the right way, your labs are neatly stored in a git repo; in this case the `devcontainer.json` file will be part of the repo.

### Devcontainer flavors

Containerlab provides two types of devcontainer images:

<h4> Docker In Docker (dind)</h4>
defined in the [.devcontainer directory](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/tree/main/.devcontainer) and tagged with

- [regular image](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/pkgs/container/containerlab%2Fdevcontainer-dind): `ghcr.io/srl-labs/containerlab/devcontainer-dind:<version>`
- [slim image](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/pkgs/container/containerlab%2Fdevcontainer-dind-slim): `ghcr.io/srl-labs/containerlab/devcontainer-dind-slim:<version>`

where `<version>` is the containerlab version without the `v` prefix.

Docker In Docker variant provides an **isolated** docker environment inside the devcontainer. This means, that the docker daemon inside the devcontainer is not connected to the docker daemon on your host, you will not see the containers/images that you have on your host.

This version is best to be used with [Codespaces](manual/codespaces.md).

<h4> Docker Outside Of Docker (dood)</h4>
defined in the [.devcontainer directory](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/tree/main/.devcontainer) and tagged with

- [regular image](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/pkgs/container/containerlab%2Fdevcontainer-dood): `ghcr.io/srl-labs/containerlab/devcontainer-dood:<version>`
- [slim image](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/pkgs/container/containerlab%2Fdevcontainer-dood-slim): `ghcr.io/srl-labs/containerlab/devcontainer-dood-slim:<version>`

where `<version>` is the containerlab version without the `v` prefix.

Docker Outside Of Docker variant uses the docker daemon on your host, so inside your devcontainer image you will see the images and containers that you have on your host. This variant is likely best to be on your local machine running macOS or Windows.

When running in this mode, VS Code will ask you to provide a path to the workspace first time you open the devcontainer. You should select the path to the repository on your host in the dialog.

The labs that we publish with Codespaces support often already have the `devcontainer.json` files, in that case you don't even need to create them manually.

### Docker In Docker (dind)

If you intend to run a docker-in-docker version of the devcontainer, create the `.devcontainer/docker-in-docker/devcontainer.json` file at the root of your repo with the following content:

```json title="<code>./devcontainer/docker-in-docker/devcontainer.json</code>"
{
    "image": "ghcr.io/srl-labs/containerlab/devcontainer-dind-slim:0.60.0" //(1)!
}
```

1. devcontainer versions match containerlab versions

With the devcontainer file in place, when you open a repo in VS Code, you will be prompted to reopen the workspace in the devcontainer. Or you can press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`.

![img1](https://gitlab.com/rdodin/pics/-/wikis/uploads/ee918d1d5d85d83f45ced031c5fa999d/image.png)

Clicking on this button will open the workspace in the devcontainer; you will see the usual VS Code window, but now the workspace will have containerlab installed with a separate docker instance running inside the spawned container. This means that your devcontainer works in isolation with the rest of your system.

Open a terminal in the VS Code and run the topology by typing the familiar `sudo clab dep` command to deploy the lab. That's it!

### Docker Outside Of Docker (dood)

The docker-in-docker method of running a devcontainer is great for Codespaces, but when running on your local machine you might want to use the images that your have already pulled in your host's docker or see the containers that might be running on your host. In these cases, the isolation that docker-in-docker provides stands in the way, and it also have some performance implications.

That's why we also have the docker-outside-of-docker (dood) variant of the devcontainer. To use this variant create the `.devcontainer/docker-outside-of-docker/devcontainer.json` file will have more meat in it, since we need to mount some host directories for containerlab to be able to do its magic:

```json title="<code>./devcontainer/docker-outside-of-docker/devcontainer.json</code>"
{
    "image": "ghcr.io/srl-labs/containerlab/devcontainer-dood-slim:0.60.0", //(1)!
    "runArgs": [
        "--network=host",
        "--pid=host",
        "--privileged"
    ],
    "mounts": [
        "type=bind,src=/run/docker/netns,dst=/run/docker/netns",
        "type=bind,src=/var/lib/docker,dst=/var/lib/docker",
        "type=bind,src=/lib/modules,dst=/lib/modules"
    ],
    "workspaceFolder": "${localWorkspaceFolder}",
    "workspaceMount": "source=${localWorkspaceFolder},target=${localWorkspaceFolder},type=bind"
}
```

1. The devcontainer version matches the containerlab version. The rest of the file does not change and can be copy pasted.

You can have both docker-in-docker and docker-outside-of-docker variants of the devcontainer file in your repo, and your IDE will be able to switch between them.

## DevPod

[DevPod](https://devpod.sh) is an open-source project by loft.sh that makes using devcontainers easier and more portable.

When compared to Devcontainers-way explained in the previous section, DevPod has the following advantages:

- improved User Experience by offering launching workspaces directly from the browser
- support for multiple IDEs and multiple target providers (locally with docker, or any cloud, or even on top of K8s)

A short demo is worth a thousand words:
