## Description

This lab demonstrates how to use a [Generic VM kind](../manual/kinds/generic_vm.md) using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS by connecting it to the SR Linux switch and running a basic ping test.

The topology is rather simple, with Ubuntu VM and SR Linux switch connected over a single interface.

```
ubuntu:eth1 <----> e1-1:SR Linux
```

## Deployment

Before deploying the lab, make sure you have built the container image for the Ubuntu VM using [hellt/vrnetlab](https://github.com/hellt/vrnetlab/tree/master/ubuntu) project. The topology file references the image as `vrnetlab/vr-ubuntu:jammy`, which is the default image name for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

After building the image, deploy the lab using the following command:

```bash
sudo containerlab deploy -t generic_vm.clab.yml
```

## Configuration

The Ubuntu 22.04 VM takes about 1 minute to complete its start up and then extra 30 seconds to allow password-based authentication over SSH. Check the boot log using `docker logs -f clab-generic_vm-ubuntu`.

### SR Linux

As seen in the topology file, the SR Linux node comes with its `ethernet-1/1` interface and subinterface preconfigured with `192.168.0.2/24` IP address. Thus no additional configuration is needed.

### ubuntu

Log into the `ubuntu` node using SSH with `ssh clab-generic_vm-ubuntu` and add the IP configuration to the `ens2` interface that connects the VM with SR Linux switch. Password is `clab@123`.

```
sudo ip addr add dev ens2 192.168.0.1/24
sudo ip link set dev ens2 up
```

## Verification

With interface on Ubuntu side configured, ping from Ubuntu to SR Linux to verify the connectivity.

```
clab@ubuntu:~$ ping 192.168.0.2
