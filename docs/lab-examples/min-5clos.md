## Description
This labs provides a lightweight folded 5-stage CLOS fabric with Super Spine level bridging two PODs.

<div class="mxgraph" style="max-width:100%;border:1px solid transparent;margin:0 auto; display:block;" data-mxgraph="{&quot;page&quot;:7,&quot;zoom&quot;:1.5,&quot;highlight&quot;:&quot;#0000ff&quot;,&quot;nav&quot;:true,&quot;check-visible-state&quot;:true,&quot;resize&quot;:true,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srl-labs/containerlab/diagrams/containerlab.drawio&quot;}"></div>

The topology is additionally equipped with the Linux containers connected to leaves to facilitate use cases which require access side emulation.

## Use cases
With this lightweight CLOS topology a user can exhibit the following scenarios:

* perform configuration tasks applied to the 5-stage CLOS fabric
* demonstrate fabric behavior leveraging the user-emulating linux containers attached to the leaves

## Configuration setup
To help you get faster to the provisioning of the services on this mini fabric we added an auto-configuration script to this example.

In order to make a fully deterministic lab setup we added another topology file called [setup.clos02.clab.yml][setup-topofile] where the management interfaces of each network node and clients are statically addressed with [`mgmt-ipv4/6` config option](../manual/nodes.md#mgmt-ipv4). Other than that, the topology files does not have any changes.

### Prerequisites
The configuration of the fabric elements is carried out with [`gnmic` client](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev/install/), therefore it needs to be installed on the machine where you run the lab.

### Run instructions
First deploy this topology as per usual:

```
containerlab deploy -t setup.clos02.clab.yml
```

Once the lab is deployed, execute the [configuration script][setup-script]:

```
bash setup.sh
```



### Configuration schema
The [setup script][setup-script] will use the following IP addresses across the nodes of the lab:


The script will configure the following:

1. IP addresses for Management, System and Link interfaces of leaves and spines.
2. IP addresses for Clients eth0 (Management) and eth1 interfaces.
3. BGP, ISIS & OSPF protocols.

The following table outlines the addressing plan used in this lab:
