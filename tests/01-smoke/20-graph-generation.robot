Generate Diagram for ${lab-name} Lab
    [Documentation]    This test runs `clab graph` to generate a diagram and verifies success.

    # Run the 'clab graph' command to generate the diagram
    ${output}=    Run Process    sudo    -E    ${CLAB_BIN}    graph    -t    ${CURDIR}/${lab-file}    --drawio    --drawio-args\=--theme nokia_modern_dark
    ...    shell=True    stdout=PIPE    stderr=PIPE

    Log    ${output.stdout}
    Log    ${output.stderr}

    # Ensure the command completed successfully
    Should Be Equal As Integers    ${output.rc}    0

    # Check for expected output messages
    Should Contain    ${output.stdout}    Diagram created successfully.

    # Check that the diagram file was created
    File Should Exist    ${CURDIR}/${diagram-file}
